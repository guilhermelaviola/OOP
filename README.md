# OOP
Object Oriented Programming concepts exemplified.

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. The data is in the form of fields, and the code is in the form of procedures. A common feature of objects is that procedures are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields.

The four principles of object-oriented programming are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. These words may sound scary for a junior developer, buy they are actually pretty easy to be understood.

### Abstraction
In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central principles (along with encapsulation and inheritance). Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

### Encapsulation
In object-oriented computer programming (OOP) languages, the notion of encapsulation (or OOP Encapsulation) refers to the bundling of data, along with the methods that operate on that data, into a single unit.

### Inheritance
In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), retaining similar implementation.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.

## Association
An association is a “using” relationship between two or more objects in which the objects have their own lifetime and there is no owner. As an example, imagine the relationship between a doctor and a patient. A doctor can be associated with multiple patients.

## Aggregation
Aggregation is a specialized form of association between two or more objects in which each object has its own life cycle but there exists an ownership as well. Aggregation is a typical whole/part or parent/child relationship but it may or may not denote physical containment.

## Composition
Composition is the design technique in object-oriented programming to implement has-a relationship between objects. Composition in java is achieved by using instance variables of other objects. For example, a person who has a Job is implemented like below in java object-oriented programming. Inheritance offers a way to reuse code by extending a class easily and with little effort. It is a valuable tool for establishing relationships between classes. In situations where you want to use an object as a field within another class, you should use composition.
